# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Read about Git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).
2. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
3. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.


### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. 7 Storyboards
1. 3 Sketches/photos of costumed devices
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of 3 prototyped interactions
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Part A. Plan 


\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*

Intonation is one of the most foundational aspects to singing and it can often be difficult to tell if you are sinigng slightly flat or sharp, especially when you are just starting out as a singer. Getting feedback by listening to yourself afterwards makes it hard to implement the proper fixes because you can't just replicate the physical feeling. Similarly, having a coach give you real-time feedback can be distracting. 

This device uses color and light to provide a visual cue for when you are off pitch. You first scan the music on a phone, then it listens to you sing with a microphone and lights up in various colors to indicate your intonation. You can then easily make the proper adjustments.

**Setting:** Vocal Practice Room really at any point in the day. 
**Players:** Singers are the primary users, but voice teachers, accompanists, and music directors may also be there.
**Activity:** Practicing new vocal material or working through vocal technique exercises. 
**Goals:** To be able to get real-time feedback on your intonation so you can correct your pitch when necessary and build up strong technique


\*\***Include pictures of your storyboards here**\*\*

![storyboards](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90526300/187245000-50ac95f2-da82-4cd3-a4f8-5db9c32b90b3.jpg)



\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*

One note I got was that it was going to be difficult to just remember the proper color codes (orange being flat and pink being sharp) so there should be a visual indicator with shape as well. 

Another piece of feedback was that just having the information of you being wrongs may not be enough. I think by adding sound that plays the right note when you are far off could be helpful as well. 

Overall, people liked the idea and could see how it could be useful for singers.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

Sometimes it was difficult to remember to look at the device when you are focusing on the sheet music. This means that the colors should be bright and the shape big enough to draw attention

It worked better when you are not trying to sing the song at the full speed and rhythm, as you had time to actually make the adjustments and move on. Solidified it as an early practice tool or for technique development. It is less useful for people who just want to quickly go through their material and get a gut check.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

It could be useful to have a statistics screen so that you can see how far off you were and track progress over time. 

The app could also have built in vocal warm ups and exercises to make it a really useful tool for just building vocal technique in general.

It is interesting  to think about how to apply this to groups singing in harmony. It culd be really useful, but I'd have to figure out how to single out specific voices and how not to have the whole rooom lighitng up chaotically. 


## Part C. Prototype the device

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*

I was unable to get Tinkerbelle to work on my phone/computer. It had no errors in the terminal window and appeared to be running as expected but when I accessed the url with the IP adress and 5001 port, it just loaded until it timed out. I was unabel to determine what was going wrong, so I worked with a friend who was not having the same issue. 


## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someoneâ€™s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*
After trying out the paper prototype, I made changes to how I was blocking out the light from different indicators to make it easier to operate while doing other action. THis helped make a more functional costume. 

## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop three costumes so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

\*\***Include sketches of what your devices might look like here.**\*\*

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*
The biggest concern is making sure that the singer can see the device while they are practicing without additional effort. The mirror-integrated option leverages the mirrors that are in nearly every practice room already for singers to be able to see the physical componenets of their technique and make adjustments. The music stand integrated version simialrly uses a piece of equipment singers are already looking at. 

THe metronome/recorder multi-purpose tool puts multiple devices that are already being used in practice rooms into one item to make it less cumbersome to get all three things set up. 


## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90526300/187266071-e9081816-45c1-4920-bb0a-f5ee74297de6.mp4


\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*
I spoke with Liz Pysher and Max Dumas about the concept and got their feedback, along with some friends who are professional performers and voice teachers from outside CT, Chloe Nadon-Enriquez and Kelli Morgan McHugh. Thank you to Liz Pysher for recording



# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)



\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

My online feedback surfaced 2 points of potential improvement. First, one reviewer suggested expanding it to groups and thinking through how that interaction would look. The other  was documenting more examples of potential use cases. Aside from that, the reviewers agreed with some of my thinking regariding why it would be difficult to memorize a color scheme, which led to the costuming decision with arrows. They seemed to like the concept overall and said that the video was clear and direct. 

In class I regrouped with Heusiu Kim, Liz Pysher, Sidarth Wadhwa, and Sylvia Ding to get further feedback. Again, the feedback was in line with my expectations. We spoke significantly about other ways to expand the tool by focusing on harmonies, providing tools for teachers and music directors to analyze performance, and for users to see progress over time. 

## Make it your own

Do last weekâ€™s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesnâ€™t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative! Feel free to fork and modify the tinkerbell code! 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
