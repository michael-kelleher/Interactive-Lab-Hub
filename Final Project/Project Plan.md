# Final Project Plan - I keep forgetting things!

## Problem Statement
Life is busy, and the to-do lists pile up. Sometimes, it can be difficult to keep track of all the little things we are supposed to do. Building new habits, routines, and practices can just be hard to remember. Of course there are no shortage of solutions to this problem, but they all fall short. Phone apps are helpful, but they just add to our already too high screentime, lead to distraction, and can be cleared and reforgotten too easily. Writing everything down by hand can be tedious, too public, and far too easy to lose. 

## Exploration of Design Space
See below for some ideation of potential solutions

## Big Idea
Every day begins and ends in the same place, brushing your teeth in front of the bathroom mirror. This is the perfect time to reinforce important to-dos and reminders. After all, you have 2 minutes just staring at yourself! 

By placing a display behind the mirror, you'll be able to see a dynamic display with all this information, as well as other widgets like the weather or your daily schedule. It can integrate with your other devices so you can send new reminders from your phone whenever they come up throughout the day

To interact with the device in real time, it will utilize an IR frame to essentially turn the entire thing into a big touch screen. It can also use a gesture sensor to be woken up so that if you have guests over, they don't see your personal to-dos unless they very unusually start swiping at your bathroom mirror. 

## Timeline
November 15-19: Finalize Design and Purchase materials
November 20-22: Build functional version of device
November 23: Testing and identify areas for improvement
November 24-26: Thanksgiving with family. No work will be done.
November 27-28: Make version 2.0 and prepare for functional checkoff
November 29 - November 30: Major deliverables for spec due. No work will be done
December 1-5: Make finished physical design.
December 6: Final Presentation
December 7-10: Finalize documentation and submit

Parts Needed:
1. Raspberry Pi (Already have)
2. Monitor (Already have)
3. 2 Way mirror or reflective film
4. IR Frame

Risks/Contingencies
1. The IR Frame may not function as well as I am hoping or may have difficulty working with the raspberry pi. In this case, this can be abandoned and the display will be static. Interaction can occur through other methods
2. The IR frame may not be available in time. In this case, the above holds true
3. The humid environment of a bathroom may not be suitable for this equipment. In production this would be put in watertight casing, but for now, it will jsut not be tested in this environment. This should make no difference in usability. 

Fall-Back Plan
This should be quite doable as the level of intricacy can scale up or down as needed. In the worst case, a simple behind-the mirror display can pull from a external device's reminder inputs. In the best case, there can be customizable touch enabled widgets on screen, voice commands, and more.
